# Roadmap

### What I have already implemented

Custom keyboards  
Dictionary Integration  
Changing word in dictionary changes corresponding word in text  
Placing infixes/discontinuous morphemes according to stress  

### What I am currently implementing

Saving and loading custom keyboards  
Various text effects (tables, bullets, colours, images etc.)

### What I need to implement/am thinking of implementing

Automatic recognition of prefixes in custom keyboards (e.g. if there is already a rule "a'>b", then the rule "a''>c" turns into "b'>c")
